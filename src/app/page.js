            At Crust & Co., every slice of pizza tells a story, a story that
            began long before our ovens ever fired up. It all started with a
            simple yet ambitious vision: to craft not just great pizza, but an
            experience. An experience that would bring people together,
            celebrate community, and make every bite unforgettable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our story dates back to the year 2000, a time when the world was
            beginning to embrace the possibilities of technology, new trends,
            and global flavors. At Crust & Co., we decided to blend these
            influences into something familiar yet innovative. We wanted to
            bring high-quality, delicious pizza to the world, but with a
            twistâ€”crafting it with passion, care, and an unwavering commitment.
